"""#1287: the prelude's declaration block is a fact about the prelude.

``_stamp_decl_order`` guards on ``name in self._decl_order`` before it
stamps anything.  ``_decl_order`` is the ACTIVE namespace — the main
file's, stamped from 0 in Pass 1 — so a main-file ``type Option = Int``
made the guard fire on the PRELUDE stamp in Pass 1.2, and the prelude's
own ``Option`` never entered ``_prelude_decl_order``.

That map is not a namespace.  ``_module_alias_scope`` builds every
module's index space as ``{**_prelude_decl_order, **module_own}``, so it
is the base layer UNDER every other namespace, and letting a main-file
declaration decide its contents is precisely the cross-namespace leak
``_decl_order`` and ``_module_decl_order`` were split apart to prevent
(PR #1224 review, quoted at ``vera/codegen/core.py``'s ``_decl_order``).

Two consequences, both measured here at the branch point:

1. ``Option`` is absent from the prelude block, and every prelude
   declaration AFTER it is off by one — the counter never advanced —
   so the block is a function of the main file's declarations, not of
   ``inject_prelude``'s output.
2. Inside a module's namespace the prelude ``Option`` then resolves at
   ``_BUILTIN_DECL_INDEX`` instead of its prelude position, and that
   wrong index is what reaches ``AliasEnv.data_types``, the value a
   consumer reads.

No rendering moves for these names — ``data_types`` changes an answer
only for ``Decimal`` and the single ``REMOVED_ALIASES`` entry ``Float``
(``naming._resolve_named``), and no prelude ADT is either — so, exactly
as ``test_adt_membership_scope_1253`` does for the same reason, the
assertions are on the index the consumer receives rather than on a
rendering that cannot distinguish it.

The control in every case is the SAME program without the shadowing
alias: the claim is an invariance, so the fixture states it as one.
