"""#1223: a generic `where`-helper under a GENERIC parent instantiates its
own generic callees.

`forall<T> fn parent` carrying a `forall<U> fn helper` is the #1002 shape:
the helper stays generic inside every clone of the parent, and both sides
already instantiate the HELPER per its concrete call sites (codegen's
`_instantiate_hoisted_generic`, the verifier's `record_nested`).  Neither
side then walked the helper CLONE's own body.  A top-level generic called
from inside the helper — `pick(@U.1, @U.0)` — was therefore discovered
only in its still-generic spelling, binding the type variable's own NAME
(`pick$U`, a clone whose `@U` parameter is not a WASM type), while the
call-rewrite asked for the concrete `pick$Bool`.  The result on a
check-clean, verify-clean program:

    [E602] … call target 'pick$Bool' not registered in this module
    [E620] 'parent$Int' … dropped
    [E620] 'main' … dropped
    Error: No exported functions

The same helper under a NON-generic parent compiles, so the trigger is the
generic ancestor: without one the helper is instantiated by the ordinary
worklist, whose every clone IS rescanned.

Two proving checks, and the second is the one that makes the fix a pair.
Locally: a differential between the clone symbols codegen REGISTERS and
the clone symbols the WASM call-rewrite RESOLVES — captured at the
consultor level, because a desync skips the calling function and elides
the dangling `call` from the WAT along with it.  Globally: the same
shapes join `tests/test_monomorphize_differential.py`'s `_INLINE_CORPUS`,
whose #732 check asserts the verifier discovers everything codegen emits
— so the codegen half alone turns that suite red, and the two halves have
to land together.
