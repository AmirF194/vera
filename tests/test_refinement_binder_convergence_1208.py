"""Codegen's refinement guard and :mod:`vera.naming` share ONE derivation.

The runtime guard for a refined parameter has to bind its predicate under
exactly the key the predicate's own ``@Base.n`` resolves to — and under the
key the checker bound that binder to.  Two hand-maintained derivations of
"chase the alias chain, name the base, conjoin the base's implicit range"
existed (``ContractsMixin._refinement_guard_parts`` and
:func:`vera.naming.refinement_binder_parts`) and had already drifted at two
corners, so this pins the surviving one against its consumer.

A DIFFERENTIAL, not a unit test on either side: the failure mode is the two
disagreeing, which a green test of each alone cannot see.  Codegen's two
WASM-specific decisions — reject a nested refinement base loudly (E618),
emit no guard at all for an erased base — are layered on top and are pinned
here too, because "converge the derivations" must not quietly drop them.
