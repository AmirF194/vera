"""#1284: whose declaration a bare ``get``/``put`` call site denotes.

The checker answers user-fn-first: :meth:`_check_call_with_args` looks the
name up as a function *before* it looks it up as an effect operation, so a
program declaring ``fn get`` has every bare ``get(...)`` in it denote that
declaration — provably, since an arity or argument-type error at such a call
site reports against the USER's signature (E201/E202), never the op's.

Codegen used to answer that question twice more, and differently.  The
declared-effect-row registration in ``vera/codegen/functions.py`` guarded its
intrinsic mapping on the function table; the handler-expression installation
in ``vera/wasm/calls_handlers.py`` overwrote ``get``/``put`` unconditionally.
From check-green source that produced, depending on the nesting shape, a
silently wrong value, a module WASM validation rejects, or a spurious
``[E602]`` skip naming a State operation the user never wrote.

Every expected value below is derived from the CHECKER's story — the user's
function was called, so its result is the answer — never from what codegen
happened to emit.  The ``pre_fix`` note on each case records what codegen
actually produced before the fix, so a case that stops distinguishing the two
answers fails loudly rather than passing vacuously.

The controls matter as much as the cases: a program that does NOT shadow the
name must still route its bare ops to the host intrinsics, which is what the
whole conformance handler corpus asserts in bulk and what
``test_unshadowed_*`` asserts here in the small.
