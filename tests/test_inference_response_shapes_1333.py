"""#1333 — `Inference.complete` must parse provider responses by SHAPE, not by position.

The reported failure: `examples/inference.vera` printed `'text'` and exited 1
against the Anthropic flagship.  `_call_inference_provider` read the Anthropic
Messages response as `data["content"][0]["text"]`, and `claude-opus-5` returns
`content` as a list of *typed* blocks that can lead with a non-text (thinking)
block.  `content[0]` therefore had no `"text"` key, the `KeyError('text')`
reached the host boundary's blanket `except Exception`, and `str(exc)` — the
bare repr of the missing key — became the whole `Result::Err` payload.

Three properties are pinned here, one per defect:

1. **Selection by type.**  The Anthropic branch collects every `type == "text"`
   block in order and joins them, so a leading thinking block is skipped rather
   than mis-read.  The OpenAI-style branch is hardened the same way: a
   `message.content` may be a string (the common case), a list of typed parts,
   or `null` on a reasoning/tool-call turn — the last of which previously
   returned the *string* `"None"` as a successful completion.

2. **Named failures.**  Every shape failure, and every HTTP rejection, names
   the provider AND the model that answered.  The maintainer's provider sweep
   for this issue misattributed the failure to xAI, because with
   `VERA_INFERENCE_PROVIDER` unset auto-detect takes the first configured key
   in registry insertion order and a still-exported Anthropic key won the
   "xAI run".  An error that names its own provider makes that class of
   misreading impossible.

3. **No bare Python spelling at the boundary.**  Only an `InferenceError` —
   the module's own class, raised at every site that has something to say —
   passes through verbatim; everything else is labelled `Inference provider
   '<p>' failed: <Type>: <msg>`, so a future shape surprise can never again
   surface as `'text'`.  The rule was originally "a plain `RuntimeError` or
   `ValueError`, by exact type", which the PR review refuted: those are the
   types an unforeseen transport failure raises too, so `RuntimeError("boom")`
   from below claimed the verbatim channel and reached the user as `boom`.

The headline cells run END TO END — a real Vera program through `execute()`
with `urllib.request.urlopen` mocked — because that is the path the maintainer
hit; `_call_inference_provider` unit cells cover the shape matrix beneath it.
No test here touches the network.
