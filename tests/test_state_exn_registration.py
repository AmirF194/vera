"""#1210: State/Exn host-import registration must cover the whole handler.

Codegen registers a `State<T>` host-cell import quadruple and an `Exn<E>`
WASM tag by walking each function for `handle` expressions.  The walk
descended a `HandleExpr`'s BODY only — not its clause bodies, not a clause's
`with` state-update expression, and not the handler's own state-init
expression.  A family reached only through one of those went unregistered
while the lowering happily emitted its calls, so a check-green, verify-clean
program died at whole-module WAT compilation with `unknown func
$vera.state_push_Nat` / `unknown tag $exn_Int`.

It also stopped at the function BODY, so a handler in a lowered CONTRACT —
a `requires` / `ensures` predicate, an `assert`, or a `decreases` measure —
was never registered while its calls were emitted.

The same walk skipped an `i32_pair` cell type in silence, where the
declared-effect path rejects it loudly (`E607`): `handle[State<String>]`
inside a `pure` function registered nothing and emitted the calls anyway.
Its Exn twin discarded the registration verdict outright, so
`handle[Exn<Unit>]` in a `pure` function compiled to a `throw` against an
undeclared tag where the declared-row spelling was a clean `E612`.

Round 5 found three more positions of the same shape, none of which the
corpus contained: a destructuring `let`'s value (`LetDestruct` was absent
from the `Block` dispatch of BOTH walkers), a module call's ARGUMENTS
(`ModuleCall` was dismissed as the imported module's business — true of the
callee, false of the args), and a signature refinement predicate (reached
through the alias table, so nothing structural finds it).  The first also
disarmed the round-3 uncompilable-payload gate: `handle[Exn<Unit>]` in a
destructuring let compiled to `unknown tag` where its `LetStmt` twin is a
clean E612 drop.

Two kinds of test here.  The shape tests pin each gap on a program whose
value is derived from the language rules, so a fix that registers the
family but lowers it wrongly still fails.  The differential is the
cross-component invariant itself — for every corpus program that compiles,
every `state_*` / `exn_*` symbol the emitted WAT REFERENCES has a matching
import or tag DECLARATION, and every HANDLER-BEARING module validates —
which is the shape of check this bug class needs: a green unit suite cannot
see a desync between the registration pass and the lowering pass, only
running both and comparing can.  The validation leg exists because the name
comparison alone is blind to a symbol declared at the WRONG TYPE, which is
invalid WASM the set difference reports as perfectly balanced.  Its scope
and its two limits are stated on the test itself; the walkers' own
completeness is gated by a field-coverage test in
`tests/test_walker_defensive_branches_597.py`, because a corpus-anchored
differential cannot flag a position no corpus program contains.

    Codegen decides which host-cell imports and exception tags a module
    declares in one pass (`_scan_body_for_state_handlers` /
    `_check_state_type`) and which ones it CALLS in another (the handler
    lowering).  A unit test on either pass cannot see them drift apart; only
    running both over real programs and comparing can, which is exactly what
    #1210 was — a family emitted but never declared.

    Two legs, because the name comparison alone is not the invariant.  The
    symbol-set leg catches an UNDECLARED symbol, over every program in the
    sweep.  The validation leg — handing the HANDLER-BEARING modules (the
    ones that reference a `state_*` / `exn_*` symbol at all; the distinct-symbol
    floor below counts SYMBOLS, not modules) to
    `wasmtime.Module`, which type-checks the whole thing — catches a symbol
    declared at the WRONG TYPE, which the name comparison reports as
    perfectly balanced: the #1231 shape declared `state_get_Bool` (i32) for a
    call the checker had typed `Int` (i64), and a Byte-literal-into-an-`Int`-
    cell shape declared the right names with mismatched value types.  Both
    passed a name-only differential while being invalid WASM.  The engine is
    `exceptions_engine()`, not a default one: at wasmtime 48.0.0, 12 of those
    39 modules fail to load when `wasm_exceptions` is off, which is a supported
    wasmtime configuration (see that helper for why the current runner, where the
    proposal defaults on, does not settle the question).

    TWO LIMITS, stated rather than implied.  First, this builds each module
    through `transform` → `codegen_compile` — a CHECKER-LESS shortcut.  The
    real toolchain threads the resolver and the checker's artifacts
    (`expr_semantic_types`, `expr_target_types`, `module_artifacts`), and the
    WAT it produces is not always the same text: measured on this corpus, 52
    of the 201 programs the toolchain compiles differ from their shortcut
    build.  The invariant under test (registration ⊇ lowering) is a property
    of the codegen pass both share, but a divergence in the shortcut's favour
    is possible in principle and this sweep would not see it.  Second, it is
    anchored, not exploratory: it holds the invariant over the programs the
    suite deliberately PLANTS in `examples/` and `tests/conformance/`, a
    corpus we curate, not an independent search for new violations — the two
    positions round 5 closed (`LetDestruct.value`, `ModuleCall.args`) had no
    corpus instance at all, which is why the shape tests above exist and why
    the walkers now carry a field-coverage gate
    (`tests/test_walker_defensive_branches_597.py`).

    The conformance suite's deliberate negatives are FILTERED OUT rather than
    swept-and-ignored (`_corpus_programs`): a program written to fail `vera
    check` never reaches codegen through the toolchain, so its emitted WAT is
    not a thing this invariant is about.
