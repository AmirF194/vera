"""#1286: the Vera-level type namers must join over `if` / `match`, not read
one branch.

#1276 fixed the WAT result-type deciders (`_infer_expr_wasm_type`,
`_infer_block_result_type`, `_infer_match_result_type`) to take the FIRST
branch that yields a type.  Their Vera-level siblings — the two consultors that
name the type of an expression for array layout and for generic clone naming —
kept the one-branch read:

* `InferenceMixin._infer_vera_type` (vera/wasm/inference.py, the WASM
  call-rewrite side) read `then_branch` only, and `arms[0]` only;
* `Monomorphizer._infer_vera_type_name` (vera/monomorphize.py, the
  instantiation-discovery side) read `then_branch` only, and had no
  `MatchExpr` arm at all.

A branch whose every path `throw`s names no type.  Reading only that branch
answered `None` for the whole expression, and the two symptoms below both
arrived from check-green (and, where a contract is present, verify-green)
source:

* as an **array-literal element**, `None` raised `CodegenSkip` and the whole
  enclosing function was dropped with the loud [E602] note — a declared
  `public fn main` that is simply not in the exports;
* as a **generic argument**, `None` left the type variable unbound, so
  discovery fell to the phantom-var default and emitted `idg$Bool` for an
  `Int` argument: `Invalid input WebAssembly code ... type mismatch: expected
  i32, found i64` at load.

The `match`-argument case was broken in BOTH directions, which is why the fix
lands on both consultors together: with every arm completing, the rewrite named
`idg$Int` from arm 0 while discovery — having no arm for `MatchExpr` — named
the phantom default, and the caller was dropped on a dangling target.  The
clone-name agreement contract (#772) is what makes the pair, not the single
function, the unit of repair.

The join property under test is order-invariance: which branch is written first
must not change the answer.  Every witness below therefore comes with its
arm-swapped twin, and the pair must agree.

The PR review round found the same divergence one shape over, and the sweep it
prompted found a third.  Discovery had no `Block` arm, and the transformer
leaves a braced match-arm body AS a `Block` — so `Some(@Int) -> { let … }` named
nothing there while the rewrite, which HAS the arm, named the concrete clone.
It reaches a wrong answer only when no later arm yields either (a plain
`None -> 0` sibling recovers the type by luck of agreement), which is why the
witness pairs the block-bodied arm with a throwing one.  The braced-`if` variant
needs the branch TAIL to be a block in its own right, a `let` inside the branch
being a statement rather than a nested block.  The third shape is a `handle` in
argument position, likewise named from its body by the rewrite and by nothing on
the discovery side.  All three are one gap: the two consultors must stay
structurally parallel, arm for arm, which is this fix's core claim.

One shape found by the same sweep is NOT closed here and is deliberately left
loud, tracked as #1327: an `IndexExpr` argument (`idg(@Array<Int>.0[1])`)
dangles the same way, but the rewrite's arm delegates to
`_infer_index_element_type`, which resolves chained indexing, aliases and
`Future` payloads against codegen tables the monomorphizer does not have.  A
partial mirror would answer differently from the rewrite for those cases —
trading a shape where both consultors say "unknown" for one where they
disagree, which is the worse failure — so it wants its own change rather than a
line here.
