"""#1244: one program, one verdict — whatever file `vera check` was given.

`mid.vera` imports only `cap` from `deep`; its body also calls `other`.
Checked directly, `mid` reported E200 (unresolved) — correct, §8.5.1: a
module's bodies resolve in the namespace ITS file declares and imports.
Checked as a dependency of `main`, the same program was accepted in
silence, because the importer only REGISTERED each module (harvesting what
it declares) and never checked its bodies at all.  The lenient verdict is
the dangerous one: it lets a module use names it never imported, and the
run then resolves them out of the importer's flat namespace.

The verifier has honoured the module-local rule regardless of entry point
since #1225, so a name that misses there missed loudly while the checker
stayed quiet.

The tests are written as EQUALITY between the two entry points rather
than as "the importer warns", because the property is agreement: a future
change that made the standalone verdict lenient would satisfy "no
disagreement" and must fail here on the standalone leg's own assertion.
