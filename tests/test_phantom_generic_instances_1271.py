"""#1271: discovery inside a still-generic scope must not instantiate a callee
at an ENCLOSING scope's type VARIABLE.

Inside ``forall<U> fn helper``, the call ``pick(@U.1, @U.0)`` binds ``pick``'s
type variable to the *name* ``U`` — a structural fact about the scope, not a
concrete type.  Discovery recorded that vector anyway, so codegen emitted a
``pick$U`` clone whose ``@U`` parameter has no WASM type and which the
compilability pass then skipped with a loud ``[E604]`` on every
generic-under-generic program.  The answer was always right; the noise is what
kept the #1223 regression shapes out of the conformance suite, since
``scripts/check_e602_clean.py`` rejects any conformance program that emits one.

The real instantiation is the one discovered once the enclosing scope is bound:
``parent$Int``'s helper clone is ``helper$Bool``, and ITS body yields
``pick$Bool``.  Filtering the phantom must leave that one untouched — so every
case below asserts the concrete clone is still emitted, not merely that the
phantom is gone.

Both sides drive the same walk (``Monomorphizer.collect_calls_in_node``), so the
filter lands once and the #732 differential in
``tests/test_monomorphize_differential.py`` holds by construction.
