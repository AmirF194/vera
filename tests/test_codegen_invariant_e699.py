"""Regression test for the CodegenInvariantError -> [E699] contract (#657).

#657 Track 2 converts type-check-impossible codegen guards (in
`vera/wasm/operators.py` and `vera/codegen/closures.py`) from a silent
`return None` to `raise CodegenInvariantError`.  The `_compile_fn` boundary
(`vera/codegen/functions.py`) catches it and surfaces a structured
`[E699]` "internal compiler error" diagnostic at `severity="error"` — a
compiler bug is reported loudly and attributed correctly (file-a-bug), never a
raw Python traceback escaping the compiler, and never mis-reported to the user
as an `[E602]` "your construct is unsupported".

Those guards are `# pragma: no cover` by construction (the type checker rejects
the inputs that would reach them), so they cannot be triggered from Vera
source.  This test forces the raise by monkeypatching `translate_block`, which
exercises the catch-side contract the guards rely on.

    The failure is injected at a *callee* of `_compile_lifted_closure`
    (`translate_block`), keyed by AST-node identity to fire only on the closure
    body — so the real `_compile_lifted_closure` runs end-to-end.  A regression

    `_compile_lifted_closure` would swallow this and fail the test (patching
    `_compile_lifted_closure` wholesale, as an earlier draft did, could not

    We assert `[E699]` is produced; we do NOT assert "no `[E602]`" because a

    *warnings* from prelude/unsupported paths regardless (the program compiles
