"""A parameterised alias APPLICATION substitutes its arguments (#1237).

``type Box<T> = T;`` declares an alias whose body is its own type parameter.
Applied — ``@Box<Cnt>`` — the resolved type is whatever ``Cnt`` resolves to;
the parameter ``T`` is a binder, not a type name.  The verifier's own
``_resolve_type`` ignored the application's type arguments entirely and handed
back the alias's registered body unchanged, so ``Box<Cnt>`` resolved to
``AdtType(name='T')`` — the binder leaking out as an ADT name.

Everything downstream that asks what a type IS then got the wrong answer.  The
reported symptom is a refinement's BASE: ``{ @Box<Cnt> | @Box<Cnt>.0 >= 18 }``
resolved its base to that phantom ADT, which fails the modelled-primitive gate
in ``SmtContext._translate_call_with_info``, so the refined-return fact was
dropped and a valid program was rejected with a spurious E501 while `vera run`
returned the right answer.

The checker has substituted since #660 (``vera/checker/resolution.py``), which
is why the program type-checks; only the verifier's parallel resolver did not.
Two halves have to move together and both are asserted here: the alias's body
must resolve its OWN parameters as type variables at registration (``T`` was
otherwise registered as an opaque ADT, and ``substitute`` maps type variables),
and the application must substitute.

Each verdict is checked against the runtime, because the two failure modes of
a wrong base — a fact that vanishes and a fact assumed that was never granted
— look identical from inside the verifier, and only `vera run` says which one
a verdict is.
