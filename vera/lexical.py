"""Shared lexical scanning for Vera source text.

The single comment scanner that both the parser's pre-lex pass and the
formatter's comment extraction are derived from.

Vera's block comments **nest** (spec 1.3): a ``{-`` inside a block
comment opens a nested comment that must be closed by its own ``-}``.
A regular expression cannot express balanced delimiters at all, so
nesting is resolved here, once, by counting depth.

#1112 arose precisely because two scanners disagreed: the formatter
counted depth correctly (and ``tests/test_formatter.py`` asserted it),
while the grammar's ``%ignore /\\{-[\\s\\S]*?-\\}/`` closed at the
*first* ``-}``.  The same text was therefore a single nested comment to
``vera fmt`` and a syntax error to ``vera check``.  Deriving every
consumer from one scan makes that drift impossible **for block
comments**.  Line and annotation comments are still recognised
independently by ``grammar.lark``; the two agree today, but a change to
either form has to be made on both sides.

This module deliberately imports nothing from ``vera.parser`` or
``vera.formatter`` — the formatter already imports the parser, so a
shared helper has to sit below both.
